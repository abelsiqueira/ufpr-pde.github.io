  title: Global Hypoellipticity of Invariant Linear Operators on Smooth Manifolds
  abstract: >
    At first glance, the subject may seem very far from the topics
    usually discussed in our seminars. However, a key point of Fernando's work is
    the study of eigenvalues/eigenvectors of matrices with special structure,
    which is also Numerical Linear Algebra matter. Therefore, this talk is an
    attempt to bring together people from different areas and create a chance for
    we help each other!

  title: Stability issues in numerical methods for a fluid-structure interaction problem
  abstract: >
    In this seminar I shall present ideas and results from the article [1]
    regarding a simplified 2-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem.
    We will consider a fluid (Euler equations) in a rectangular domain coupled
    with  generalized springs on the horizontal boundaries. Three possible
    algorithms for the solution of the problem will be shown  and their
    stability will be analyzed by the introduction of a linear operator called
    "added-mass".
