  title: Global Hypoellipticity of Invariant Linear Operators on Smooth Manifolds
  abstract: >
    At first glance, the subject may seem very far from the topics
    usually discussed in our seminars. However, a key point of Fernando's work is
    the study of eigenvalues/eigenvectors of matrices with special structure,
    which is also Numerical Linear Algebra matter. Therefore, this talk is an
    attempt to bring together people from different areas and create a chance for
    we help each other.
