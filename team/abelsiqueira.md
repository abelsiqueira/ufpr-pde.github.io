Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department.

I have a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the State
University of
Campinas, and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the same university, in the
field of Nonlinear Optimization.

My interests are in the computational aspects of optimization; the development and
implementation of nonlinear programming methods; the study of new methods and
techniques for solving computational problems.
